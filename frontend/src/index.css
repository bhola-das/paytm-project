/*Bearer:- the Authorization header includes a Bearer token, which is retrieved from localStorage.
 This token acts as proof of authentication and is required to access protected routes,
  such as fetching the user's account balance. The server verifies the token, and if
   it's valid, it responds with the requested data. This approach ensures secure API
    communication without needing to store session data on the server, making it a
     stateless and efficient authentication mechanism." */
